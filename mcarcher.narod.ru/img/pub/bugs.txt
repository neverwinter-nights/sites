Arma version: Arma2 + Arma2:OA + patch 1.54

Bugs:

1. Me and AI in my group have very ugly model. See screenshot at http://www.mcarcher.narod.ru/img/pub/arma2co_1.54_critical_bugs_screen_1.jpg
2. Another bug with AI. The following code doesn't work properly in Dedicated server. Explanation below.

[code]
if (isServer) then
{
	{
		if (not (isPlayer _x)) then
		{
			_x disableAI "MOVE";
			_x disableAI "TARGET";
			_x disableAI "AUTOTARGET";
			diag_log format ["Unit %1 was set unmovable.", _x];///////////////////dbg
		}
		else { diag_log format ["Unit %1 skipped as player.", _x]; };///////////////////dbg};
	} forEach playableUnits;	
};
[/code]

It says that an AI in my group is a player! Myabe 'isPlayer' functon, or something else is bugged?!...
Note: on non-dedicated server everything works in this par of code as it should.
